# Literature survey of algorithms to compute Longest Common Subsequence
This project contains implementation of four different algorithms to compute Longest common subsequence of two string sequences. 
The string sequences are generated and performances of algorithms are compared.

# Algorithms implemented
* Recursive algorithm
* Recursive memoized (top-down dynamic programming) algorithm
* Bottom up dynamic programming algorithm
* Hirschberg's linear space and quadratic time algorithm

# Testing algorithms
* run the file `run.sh` to run experiments on all four algorithms
* a `.txt` file is generated for each algorithm which contains time taken and memory consumend to compute/reconstruct lcs. 
The values from this file can be used to create plot and compare results.

# Results
* some images are included in the folder `images/`
